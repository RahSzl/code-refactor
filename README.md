# Horiseon-code-refactor

## Description
I generally improved the accessibility standards of the webpage. The source code was altered 
to contain semantic HTML elements. I added an alt description to all of the icons and images
on the webpage. I made sure all of the heading attrubutes were in sequential order and that the the page's
elements were organized in a logical way. And finally, I added a more decriptive title to the webpage and optimized the CSS file.
